I was a member of the Missouri All-State Band for all four years of high school

I originally started on the Tenor Saxophone, and eventually picked up the Baritone my freshman year and just started playing Alto Sax. last year.

I recieved a scholarship to play saxophone at the University of Missouri and so far it has been an amazing experience.
